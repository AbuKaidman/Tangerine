1)  Running sample assessments that include every type of subtest

  a.	Doing things within those subtests like

    i.	Testing that autostop works (done)

    ii.	Testing that skiplogic works (done)
  
    iii.	Testing that reading comprehension questions are properly linked to how far the student has read (done)
    
    iv.	Testing that you can’t skip subtests without entering data (done)
    
    v.	….many more things….
    
    vi. Action on Display items
                -skipping entire subtests (done)
                
                -survey early stop logic (done) 
                
                -dynamic question prompts
                
    vii. Custom validation (still working on this)
    
    viii. Testing if abort and resume work with and w/o randomization (still working on this) 

    
  b.	Examining the results and making sure they look right
  
    i.	Expand the result on the results page and sanity check
    
    ii.	(perhaps downloading the CSV – this will be harder)
    
2)	Creating assessments using the editor

    i. Using text editor, bold, italic, font size, etc. 
    
    ii. Testing if a subtest can be copied to another assessment (done) 
    
    iii. Duplicating an assessment (done) 
    
    iv. Testing if questions can be copied to different assessments (done)
