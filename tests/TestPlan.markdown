1)  Running sample assessments that includes every type of subtest

  a.	Doing things within those subtests like

    i.	Testing that autostop works

    ii.	Testing that skiplogic works
  
    iii.	Testing that reading comprehension questions are properly linked to how far the student has read
    
    iv.	Testing that you can’t skip subtests without entering data
    
    v.	….many more things….
    
  b.	Examining the results and making sure they look right
  
    i.	Expand the result on the results page and sanity check
    
    ii.	(perhaps downloading the CSV – this will be harder)
    
2)	Creating assessments using the editor
