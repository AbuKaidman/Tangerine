The child should perceive the following  assessment almost as a game to be enjoyed rather than an exam. It is important to read ONLY the sections in  boxes aloud slowly and clearly.  </div><h2>Introduction</h2><div class='student-dialog'>Good morning. My name is ____ and I live in _____. I’d like to tell you a little bit about myself. [Number  and ages of children; pets; sports; etc]<li>1. Could you tell me a little about yourself and your family? [Wait for response; if student is reluctant, ask question 2, but if they seem comfortable continue to verbal consent].<li>2. What do you like to do when you are not in school?  </div>  <h2>Verbal consent</h2> <div class='student-dialog'> Let me tell you why I am here today. I work with the Ministry of Education and we are trying to understand how children learn to read.  You were picked by chance, like in a raffle or lottery. We would like your help in this. But you do not have to take part if you do not want to.<li>We are going to play a reading game.  I am going to ask you to read letters, words and a short story out loud.<li>I will also ask you other questions about your family, like what language your family uses at home and some of the things your family has.<li>I will NOT write down your name so no one will know these are your answers.<li>Once again, you do not have to participate if you do not wish to.  Once we begin, if you would rather not answer a question, that’s all right.<li>Do you have any questions? Are you ready to get started?</li></div>      <form>      <div data-role='fieldcontain'>          <fieldset data-role='controlgroup' data-type='horizontal'>            <legend>Does the child consent?</legend>              <label for='consent-yes'>Yes, continue</label>              <input type='radio' name='childConsents' id='consent-yes' value='true' />              <label for='consent-no'>No, stop</label>              <input type='radio' name='childConsents' id='consent-no' value='true' />          </fieldset>      </div>      </form>",
