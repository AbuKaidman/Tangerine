Touch the word again to count self-corrections as correct (it will no longer be blue). <li>Stay quiet, except when providing answers as follows: if the child hesitates for 3 seconds, provide the word, point to the next word and say <b>“Please go on.”</b> Mark the word you provide to the child as incorrect. \n<br/>\nAFTER 60 SECONDS,  SAY  <b>“STOP.”</b> Touch the [Stop] button, then touch the   last word read (be sure it is still appropriately marked either correct or incorrect). <br/> \nEarly stop rule: If you have marked as incorrect all of the answers on the first line, say <b>“Thank you!”</b>, touch the [Stop] button, mark the last letter attempted ensuring that it is still marked incorrect, and go on to the next exercise.\n",

Do you understand what you are to do? When I say “begin,” read the story as best as you can.  I will keep quiet & listen to you, unless you need help. Ready? Begin.",
